# hapi-auth-iron
Hapi.js Authentication Plugin using iron module for Bearer Token Encryption.

Given the discussion on: https://github.com/ideaq/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/27
We decided to write an alternative module/plugin using
[**iron**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iron) for auth token
encryption (instead of [JWTs](https://github.com/docdis/learn-json-web-tokens) )

If you have time to contribute to the development/documentation of this
module, please get in touch!
